# How-to Guides
Here you can find some guides that will help you get up to speed in using <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">libmg</span> in your work.

## [Installation](installation.md)
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">libmg</span> can be installed with pip (recommended) or from source. In this section you will find the prerequisites 
and the means to verify your installation.

## [How to define a dataset](datasets.md)
A $\mu\mathcal{G}$ model is run on a given dataset. Here you will find how to define a dataset of graphs.

## [How to define functions](functions.md)
A $\mu\mathcal{G}$ is built by assembling the basic terms from $\psi$, $\phi$ and $\sigma$ functions. Here you will find how these functions can be defined.

## [How to define a compiler](compiler.md)
The compiler for $\mu\mathcal{G}$ expressions must be instantiated given the functions that are to be used and some configuration information. Here you will 
find what kind of configuration is needed.

## [How to create, run, and optimize models](models.md)
Creating a $\mu\mathcal{G}$ model consists in compiling a $\mu\mathcal{G}$ expression. The model can then receive graphs in input using the adequate dataset
loader. Models can also be traced by the compiler using dummy data.  

## [Visualization procedures](visualization.md)
Here you will find information on how to visualize graphs and model outputs on your web browser.
